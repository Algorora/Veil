# Veil Protocol

## Overview

Veil is a privacy-focused protocol designed to provide anonymous and secure communication over the network. It aims to offer robust privacy features, decentralized architecture, and resistance against various attacks without relying on onion routing.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption:** All communication between nodes is end-to-end encrypted, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data.
- **Decentralized Network:** Veil employs a decentralized network architecture to reduce the risk of a single point of failure and increase resistance to attacks.
- **Hidden Services:** Support for hidden services allows users to host services anonymously within the network.
- **Traffic Analysis Resistance:** Veil includes features to resist traffic analysis, such as padding and dummy traffic to obscure communication patterns.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Dynamic changes in routing paths enhance security and prevent traffic analysis.
